# Dev notes – 2025-11-21

## 13:30–14:00
- Rebuilt WRF with `em_real`; executables now in `compilation-20251121/main/` (`real.exe`, `wrf.exe`, `ndown.exe`, `tc.exe`, `ideal.exe`).
- Runtime still failing in `suewsdrv` due to `gsModel=0` from SUEWS inputs; adjusted conductance/site files (codes 200/551–557, gsModel=1) and enabled verbose debug (`debug_level=100`, `diagnose=1`, `SuppressWarnings=0`). Crash persists.
- Began isolated SUEWS patch build in `suews-patched-build` to clamp invalid `gsModel` but library rebuild currently blocked in `suews_ctrl_sumin.f95` (type mismatch with `-Dwrf`). No changes applied to tracked `SUEWS/lib` yet.
- WRF and SUEWS submodules remain clean; all modifications confined to `compilation-20251121/`, `WSPS/sample-case/input/...`, and `suews-patched-build/`.
